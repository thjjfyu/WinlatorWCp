> - WCP is a custom component bundle for the Winlator ecosystem, originating from the old glibc fork and currently used mainly with ```CMod```. It’s essentially a tar.zst archive with a .wcp extension. Even if WCP installs aren’t supported, you can simply unpack it and use the contents anywhere if you know the basics.

### 🌀 FEXCore & Box64

|:-:|-|
| **FEXCore**  | Handles both 32-bit and 64-bit. Pairing it with ARM64EC-built graphics runtimes like DXVK/VKD3D can reduce x64 translation boundaries and further lower overhead. |
| **Box64** | Power user friendly. Extensive dynarec tuning on top of a fast JIT and native-library bridges. |

- With the ```2509``` update, Unity game performance has improved on ```FEX``` as well.
- Unity games are generally more stable when run with ```Box64```.
- Basic ```Box64``` settings for unity games: ```STRONGMEM=1+``` ```CALLRET=0``` ```WEAKBARRIER=0~1```
- ```WEAKBARRIER``` can mitigate the performance hit from ```STRONGMEM```, but regressions or crashes have been reported depending on the build/version/game. If issues occur, set it to ```0```.

### ⚡ DXVK (DX8-11)
> [!NOTE]
> ```v2.5``` is **NOT** recommended.

| DXVK-GPLAsync-LowLatency | | |

<details>
  <summary>💡Useful info</summary>
<br> 

| Type | 📝 |
|:-:|-|
| **Sarek**    | Backports for older Vulkan. Keeps DXVK usable on Vulkan 1.1/1.2 hardware, with practical tweaks for legacy GPUs. |
| **GPLAsync** | DXVK + Async shader compilation + GPL cache to cut visible stutter during compilation. |
| **ARM64EC**  | Designed to run with ❗FEX❗ to minimize x64→ARM translation and reduce overhead. |

- As a general pick, go with ```DXVK-Sarek``` or ```DXVK 2.4.1```
- Recent ```GPLAsync``` builds may increase stuttering in certain games.
- In GPU-bound scenarios, ```ARM64EC``` has little to no impact on average FPS.
- If the game has a built-in frame limiter, use that. In some cases, ```DXVK_FRAME_RATE``` can introduce stutter.

### 🧬 VKD3D-Proton (DX12)

| Type | 📝 |
|:-:|-|
| **ARM64EC** | Designed to run with ❗FEX❗ to minimize x64→ARM translation and reduce overhead. |

- If it isn’t required, **leave the ```VKD3D feature level``` at its default**. Forcing a higher feature level can trigger different code paths and extra shader compilation, which may lead to stutter.
- You can limit the frame rate using: ```DXVK_FRAME_RATE``` or ```VKD3D_FRAME_RATE```
- If the game has a built-in frame limiter, use that. In some cases, ```..._FRAME_RATE``` can introduce stutter.

- If VC++ errors persist in an ARM64EC container, install ```Visual C++ ARM64```
- If older VC++ is needed, try an [**AIO package**](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist). <br>
- May require the official [**.NET Framework**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/ko-kr/download/dotnet-framework) instead of Mono.
